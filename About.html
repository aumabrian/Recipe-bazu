    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h3>
<p>Granny’s Pie was started because we knew that traditions could be centered around a family table and special food and we wanted to bring people together to come and experience with us; and because we wanted our pies to start new family traditions while still honoring the old. We pride ourselves on crafting each of our pies with care and baking them until they reach perfection because at our table, family is always welcome, but the food has to earn its place</p>

    <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
    <p>Granny’s Pie Factory was founded in 2011 by Alex and Mariam. While Alex was a newcomer to the bakery business, Mariam had over 22 years of experience in restaurants, bakery and ice cream manufacturing, over 17 of which were spent focused entirely on pies. In 2016 their son Martin joined the business bringing with him his passion for quality, some new skills and a desire to uphold and expand on the values on which his parents built their business. The business has been doing well and all the gratitudes are to our customers whom have been supported us and giving us cordial words of encouragements. </p>

<h2>OUR FUTURE</h2>
    <p>We continue to grow and expand our horizons while upholding our passion for honesty, quality and commitment to making an excellent product. We will be able to open our branches in some areas and cities in the near future. We will continue to wake up everyday and provide people with a reason to come together and enjoy the best dishes, and maybe promotions. Let our pies become a part of your family and invite others too.</p>
